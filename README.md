# Airport Identity Analytics System

## Overview

This project aims to create a robust and scalable identity verification system for a large international airport. The system combines machine learning techniques such as facial recognition and gait analysis with real-time and historical analytics to identify individuals and flag unauthorized or suspicious activities. 

## Assumptions

- The system is designed for a large international airport with high footfall.
- The primary use-cases include security screening, automated check-ins, and historical footage analysis.
- Data is both real-time and historical.

## Technologies Used

- **Data Streaming**: Kafka (real-time), RabbitMQ (message queuing)
- **Data Storage**: Amazon S3 (long-term storage), Local Disk (short-term storage)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (structured data), Elasticsearch (search and analytics)
- **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow (model training), PyTorch (inference), OpenCV (video processing)
- **Backend Frameworks**: Flask (APIs), Django (admin and dashboard)
- **Monitoring and Alerting**: Grafana (real-time analytics), Kibana (log monitoring)
- **Security**: SSL/TLS (transmission), AES-256 (storage)

## Setup

### Phase 1: Hardware and Data Transmission
- **Cameras**: Multiple IP cameras for comprehensive coverage.
- **Sensors**: Pressure sensors for gait analysis integrated with IoT devices.
- **Data Transmission**: Real-time video and sensor data streaming.

### Phase 2: Data Ingestion and Preprocessing
- **Ingestion Engine**: Use Kafka for real-time data and RabbitMQ for task queues.
- **Preprocessing**: Apply image and video filters to enhance quality.

### Phase 3: Analytics Engine
- **Object Detection**: Algorithms like YOLO or SSD for real-time tracking.
- **Identification**: Facial and gait recognition models trained using TensorFlow.

### Phase 4: Database and Backend Services
- **Structured Data**: Use PostgreSQL for storing user profiles and other structured data.
- **Search and Analytics**: Elasticsearch for complex queries and analytics.
  
### Phase 5: Monitoring and Alerting
- **Dashboard**: Use Grafana for real-time dashboards.
- **Logging**: Kibana for log aggregation and monitoring.

### Phase 6: Security Measures
- **Data in Transit**: Use SSL/TLS for secure data transmission.
- **Data at Rest**: Encrypt stored data using AES-256.
