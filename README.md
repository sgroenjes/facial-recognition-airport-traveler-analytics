# Airport Identity Analytics System

## Overview

This project aims to create a robust and scalable identity verification system for a large international airport. The system combines machine learning techniques such as facial recognition and gait analysis with real-time and historical analytics to identify individuals and flag unauthorized or suspicious activities. 

## Development Board

## Assumptions

- The system is designed for a large international airport with high footfall.
- The primary use-cases include security screening, automated check-ins, and historical footage analysis.
- Data is both real-time and historical.

## Technologies Used

- **Data Streaming**: Kafka (real-time), RabbitMQ (message queuing)
- **Data Storage**: Amazon S3 (long-term storage), Local Disk (short-term storage)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (structured data), Elasticsearch (search and analytics)
- **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow (model training), PyTorch (inference), OpenCV (video processing)
- **Backend Frameworks**: Flask (APIs), Django (admin and dashboard)
- **Monitoring and Alerting**: Grafana (real-time analytics), Kibana (log monitoring)
- **Security**: SSL/TLS (transmission), AES-256 (storage)

## Setup and Development Workflow

1. **Development Environment Setup**: 
    - Ensure that all necessary development tools and libraries are installed and configured for each team member.

2. **Database Initialization**:
    - Set up the PostgreSQL database with the initial schema.
    - Implement basic CRUD operations in `db_operations.py`.

3. **Data Ingestion and Preprocessing**:
    - Develop `video-capture.py` to capture and handle video streams.
    - Create preprocessing filters in `image_filters.py` to enhance video feed quality.

4. **Analytics Engine Development**:
    - Populate `identity_recognition.py` with facial recognition capabilities.
    - Implement object detection in `object_detection.py`.

5. **Monitoring and Alerting**:
    - Set up Grafana and Kibana for system monitoring and log aggregation.

6. **Service Initialization Scripts**:
    - Write scripts for initializing and shutting down system services (`init.sh`, `start_services.sh`, `stop_services.sh`).

7. **APIs and User Interface**:
    - Design and develop backend APIs.
    - Create a user-friendly dashboard for real-time monitoring and system management.

8. **Security Implementation**:
    - Set up SSL/TLS for secure data transmission.
    - Implement AES-256 encryption for data at rest.

9. **Documentation**:
    - Document the system setup, API usage, and operational procedures.

10. **Testing and Continuous Integration**:
    - Establish a testing framework and continuous integration process.

## Usage

1. **Starting the System**: Step-by-step guide to initialize all components.
2. **User Interface**: Description of dashboard and other interfaces.
3. **Alerts**: Configurations for various types of alerts (e.g., unauthorized entry, system failure).
4. **API Endpoints**: Comprehensive documentation of the APIs, including sample queries.
